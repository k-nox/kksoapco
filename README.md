# Kindred & Knox Soap Co

I'm creating this project to fulfill the requirements for the [third Responsive Web Design project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page) in the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

This project is for a hypothetical soap company but may eventually be used as the starting point for an actual functioning soap business.

While I am submitting this project for now & moving on to the next project, I plan to come back to this later and polish the CSS up quite a bit.
